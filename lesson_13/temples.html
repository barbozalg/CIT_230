            <h2>Why Latter-day Saints Build Temples</h2>
            <p> Latter-day Saints are a temple-building and temple-loving people. It has been so from the earliest days of the Church. Through the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Lord declared that "my people are always commanded to build [temples] unto my holy name" (D&C 124:39-40).</p>

            <h2>Draw Nearer to Christ</h2>
            <p> Everything in the temple points us to Jesus Christ. As we participate in temple ordinances, we are assured that He is mindful of us. He is involved in our lives and He is dedicated to our eternal happiness. His presence can be felt as we strive to follow Him in our daily lives. As we draw closer to the Savior, we learn more about Him. His life provides a perfect pattern of righteousness and happiness for all of us.</p>

            <img src="images/families-and-the-temple.jpg" alt="Families and the Temple">
            <h2>Families and the Temple</h2>
            <p>The family is ordained of God and is central to His plan for our eternal happiness. Families are intended to help God’s children learn and grow in righteousness. Marriage between a man and a woman is also ordained of God. Husband and wife have a sacred responsibility to love and care for each other and for their children. As you follow the teachings of Jesus Christ, God will bless you and your family.</p>

        <div>
            <img src="images/why-ordinances-and-covenants.jpg" alt="Why Ordinances and Covenants Matter">
            <h2>Why Ordinances and Covenants Matter</h2>
            <p>To the prophet Moses, God delivered in clear language His ultimate desire for each member of the human family: “For behold, this is my work and my glory, to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man” (see Moses 1:39). The way all of us can receive these gifts is through the Atonement of Jesus Christ and obedience to the commandments. Jesus Christ is our Savior, the only One who has the power to save us from the effects of sin and death. As we give our all to change our behavior to match His will—a process called repentance—He can change our attitudes, give us additional strength to choose the right, and ultimately change our nature. In short, Jesus Christ can help us become like Him.</p>
